  <p>My name is Suzhi Li and my English name is Sushi. It is a funny story of why I have this name but it is a bit long so if you are interested in it, you can go to my website. I come from China. For me, my hobbies are quite wide, I like playing video games, doing exercise, reading, even trying to write some stories and watching anime. At first, I wanted to apply Game Design but because of some surprise situations, I chose to study Information Technology at the end. However to be a game designer still is my goal and I will keep pursuing it in the future.</p>

Like other teenagers I am addicted to video games, it is the part of the reason that I choose IT as my major in University. I am a team player and always like to make new friends online all over the world so I prefer muti-player games. I am also a fan of cycling, it is a convenient transport for my hometown because Amoy is a small Island.</p>
