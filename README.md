  <h2>Idea Job:</h2>
  
  <p>All our ideal jobs are IT related and have high salaries. All of these jobs require teamwork and good communication, as well as a knowledge of some programming language, or at least one. And some jobs also require the employee to have some working experience.</p>
  
  <p>Although our ideal jobs are all related to it, they are in different fields. For example, the position of project manager is not in the studio most of the time. The project manager is more of a position of taking overall responsibility, like a leader leading the team.But for game developers, they need to master many related technologies, not only the programming language, but also the skilled use of 3D development tools and game engines.</p>
  
  <p>Most of us will choose to be programmers, but some of us will not be in the relevant industry. May choose some do not need programming knowledge career, will choose other direction of development, such as project manager or consultant.</p>

  <h2>IT Work</h2>
  
  <p>Q1.Hi, we are students from rmit Information Technology and would like to interview you for some questions, first of all can you tell us about your job and what exactly you do?
</p>
  
  <p>Of course, I am currently a programmer working for Amazon. The main job is back-end development, mainly for business control and processing, such as accessing the database and making data updates to view changes. The main things to consider are how to implement the functionality, access to the data, stability and performance of the platform, etc.</p>
  
  <p>Q2.Is there any other work you need to do?</p>
    
  <p>It's mainly about which elements I've described above, writing code and implementing some functionality. If I had to say anything else, it would be the need to attend some internal meetings.</p>
  
  <p>Q3.Who do you need to communicate with in your general work?</p>
  <p>In internal meetings like the one I just mentioned, I usually have to communicate with the boss, the operations engineer, the operations and maintenance person or the front-end programmer, and sometimes with the users.</p>
  
  <p>Q4.Can you tell us what you usually discuss in your communication with other people?</p>
  <p>First of all you need to understand the role of each department. Our back-end engineers write the code and  operations , maintenance engineers deploy and monitor it, so communication with them usually revolves around the code. With the product managers, we will mainly discuss customer requirements and discuss business logic; with other programmers, we will discuss code reviews and help each other.</p>
  
  <p>Q5.What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</p>
  <p>Programmers spend most of their time in front of a computer, where we are constantly working on fixing the wrong code, as well as writing new ones.</p>
  
  <p>Q6.What do you think is the most challenging aspect of a programmer's job?</p>
  <p>It is still mainly the process of writing and modifying code, and the fact that computer technology is updated at such a fast pace that we all need to keep learning.</p>
  
  <p>Q7.It was a very good interview experience, can you give us some advice at the end?</p>
  <p>It's a good idea to define your direction before you work and ask yourself what type of work you actually like. And you need to keep learning and improving your skills.</p>
  
  <h2>IT Technologies:</h2>
  <h3>Autonomous vehicles: </h3>
  <p>What does it do?</p>
  <p>Autonomous vehicles, as be called self-driving car, driverless car or robo-car, as its name, the function of this system is to let the car move safely with less even without any person. The history of Autonomous vehicles can be retrospected to between 1920s to 1930s and the first Autonomous vehicles appeared in the 1980s. </p>
  <p>Nowadays, In the USA, the organization call NHTSA divide six rank for automation driving:</p>
  <p>Rank 0: No automation driving, it means that the driver must totally control the whole mechanical engineering and physics function, even another function which does not affect the driving like a warning system etc.</p>
  <p>Rank 1 (‘hands on’): The driver controls the car but some of the functions can work automatically like ESP or ABS to keep the driving safe.</p>
  <p>Rank 2 (‘hands off’): The driver monitors the driving and prepares for any immediate situation and an automated system takes full control of the vehicle to relieve the driving difficulty like ACC, ATS, LDWS and AEB etc.</p>
  <p>Rank 3 (‘eyes off’): The driver needs to prepare to control the car in any possible time. Sometimes the vehicles may move automatically like during following cars but when the vehicles detect any urgency situation which needs the driver it will immediately let the driver take the control for follow-up situations.</p>
  <p>Rank 4 (‘mind off’): The driver can let the vehicles totally automatically drive, when the system starts, the driver almost no need to get involved, the car will follow the original decided way moving and execute works like swerve, changing lane and speed up etc. However, when during severe weather, the road of fuzz, accident or the automatically driving way is finishing, the automation system will offer enough turning time for drivers.</p>
  <p>Rank 5 (‘steering wheel optional’): The driver no need to sit in the car and do not need to control the car anytime. The car can automatically start the automotive driving system, choosing the ways and executing every function which connects to safety, even the situation which depends on one in the car. It no needs to be controlled by the will of the driver, it can control by itself.</p>
  <p>For nowadays, most autonomous vehicles are at rank 1 or 2, only less of them reach rank 3. </p>
  <p>For example, in 2018, Audi showcased a world-first for production level 3 autonomous vehicle in the Audi A8. For this car, there is a function called ‘Traffic Jam Pilot’.To start the function, there is a button called ‘Audi AI’, when you push the button, the 'Traffic Jam Pilot’ will start to work. It will begin to steer, accelerate and brake on its own and work with the max speed of 60km/h. Moreover, it also can keep to the left of the lane at lower speeds for allowing safe passage for emergency vehicles and other non-motor vehicles. Also will move to center with speed increasing.</p>
  <p>In further development, some famous companies like Tesla plan to research higher autonomous vehicles and show a level 4 full self-driving video in 2019. Not only Tesla plans to research higher level of autonomous vehicles, other famous companies like Jaguar, plan to detour autonomous vehicles in 2024, Daimler and Ford plan to destroy fully autonomous vehicles at market in 2025 and IEEE specialists forecast more than 75% vehicles will be automated by 2035. </p>
  <p>To make this happen, AI technology, more advanced ultrasonic, radar and laser sensors technology will be needed. Because for autonomous vehicles, they need ultrasonic, radar and laser sensors to acquire immediate information around the vehicles, then, it needs high intelligence and effective AI to dispose and correctly reflect at a blind of time. Thus, these technologies are important to reach the goals.</p>
  
  <p>What is the likely impact?</p>
  
  <p>One major potential impact will be about significant health and safety benefits, this technology may reduce the traffic accidents and fatalities. A study of a recent McKinsey & Company found that autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems may reduce motor vehicle death by 90 percent and decrease the more than $190 billion every year in health care costs. </p>
  <p>Based on this change, some insurance companies conducting business will be influenced. By the effect of autonomous vehicles, the human-caused accidents would decrease. Some insurance companies might rethink traditional business models. Like Google, Mercedes and Volvo, they have stated a new self-insuring for their own products.</p>
  <p>For the people part, the people who will be most affected will be the people who work in transportation and medicine. The amount of traffic accidents will be reduced by the increasing autonomous driving system. Moreover, when every car popularizes autonomous driving, the frequency of traffic guidance will decrease too. It will reduce the pressure of transportation and for each country. The medicine part will be affected by this situation too. When the number of traffic accidents decrease, the amount of people who die and be hurted will reduce too. By the change, medical workers will reduce the stress not only from the physics part but also for the psychological aspects.</p>
  <p>In the job part, autonomous vehicles will make a serious negative for some traditional jobs. For example, by the increase of autonomous vehicles, the expenditure for owning autonomous vehicles will be cheaper and cheaper. Thus, more and more people will have the ability to own autonomous vehicles.Moreover, autonomous vehicles are easier to be used and studied so autonomous vehicles will cause the situation of every one can get around with their own car. In this situation, the driver’s job will be strongly impacted because no one needs a driver anymore, the job will decrease fastly even disappear in the end. This situation not only happens in private, but also will happen in some companies like farming or mining industry etc. With the increase of technology, each large machinery will use the technology too. Thus the person who is trained to use the machineries will be no longer needed anymore.</p>
  
  <p>How will this affect you?</p>
  
  <p>For most of the private people,this technology will mainly affect their daily life. First effect will be the ways of the trip. By autonomous vehicles’ popularization, driving licenses will be more easily taken. People’s main trip mode will be using the car. Moreover, using these cars will decrease the danger of driving, by the help of the system, there will be less even no fatigue driving any more. Less traffic accidents will enhance people’s happiness index. Second will be time management. In traditional driving, people need to focus on controlling the car during driving or it will be dangerous. However, by the help of autonomous vehicles, people will have a chance to do other things during the trip like studying or preparing for further work. It will increase efficiency. </p>
  <p>For a family or friends. Road trip is one of the activities for a family or a group of friends. However, before arriving at a goal place, the journey may be boring and stressful. With the help of autonomous vehicles, family members and groups of people can do many things during the journey. It will make a journey much fun and close the distance between each person. Moreover, autonomous vehicles need a high level of AI technology, high advanced ultrasonic, radar and laser sensors technology. Studying technology will increase the understanding of other parts.</p>

  <h3>Cyber security </h3>
  
  <p>Information technology is always an essential way which improves people’s livelihood since it was created. As time has gone on, people literally realized that the computer and the internet have become the most important component of their life, even in the world. However, the internet world is huge, it controls the private information of everyone who has direct or indirect access to the internet. So naturally there also exists a hidden peril just like this world, there are the good man and the bad. A part of people always wants to allocate personal details or secret intelligences to reap staggering profits through illegal means on the internet. Like they sell people’s phone number and home address for some organizations. When they get this information, it will be easy for the staff to defraud or promote the sale of goods. Cyber security is born from an event. A researcher, Bob Thomas, who created a program called Creeper. This program can run in Arpanet’s network, leaving a trail whatever it went and engraved a sign, it read “I’m the creeper catch me if you can”. Ray Tomlinson, the inventor of email, wrote the program reaper, which chased and deleted the Creeper. The Reaper is the first example of antivirus software and also the first self-replicating program. Thus, it becomes the first-ever computer worm. Cyber security is a technology of protection systems to obstruct the cyber-attacks or outside users of unauthorized access. As technology has become more accessible, threats like hacking have become more prevalent. Meanwhile, the interaction brings that as more antivirus scanners hit the market. The continuing of cyber-attack and cyber-defend set off the rapid development of both technologies. According to the HISCOX small business cyber risk report, forty-seven percent of small businesses suffered at least one cube attack in the past 12 months and the rest are suffering more unknown internet’s risks. Obviously, it is expected, comparing the big companies that the small companies were easily invaded. Because, they do not have enough funds as many as big companies to employ the specific staff and create a department for their interior network maintenance. Sometimes for large corporations, a data breach could be the end of a company. Thus, that is why they attach importance to cyber security.  With the internet available in more homes and offices across the global, cybercriminals had more chances to utilize software vulnerabilities to steal customers' information. The 2010s, many cases of intentional cybercrime affected most of the country's security, moreover, it brought over hundreds of millions of losses by some enterprises. A lot of programs had already been developed for computer virus deletion and digital self-defense. Most of them were installed in software, either it provides initial protection by setting up a firewall to scan computers for viruses, worms, and Trojan bourse. And also, the effective way what we tend to do for cyber security at now, is having a strong password. Because it is a common method that hacker’s access other companies' systems through password stealing. Thus, a powerful and firm password is the most effective way to protect your private information. As cybersecurity developed to tackle expanding range of attack methods, those attackers also solved new means: multi-vector attacks and social engineering. Attackers become smarter thus cyber security were forced to innovate, the next generation. Next-gen cyber security uses different ways scanning unknown threats, while also reducing the number of false positives. One of the new technologies is multi-factor authentication. Basically, it works by adding an extra layer of security to your account that prevents someone if having your password and permits access from logging. For instance, when you log in to an online account, you provide a password and need to offer a second piece of information about what you were setting before.</p>
  
  <p>As cyber security develops, the competition of trade will become fiercer. Like both different rival companies can take network warfare, they hire scientists and technicians’ staff by information stealing and destroying attacks launched by such malware as viruses. But development can bring another chance, more job applications. Information security analysts protect networks from cyber threats, they will analyze, assess, and investigate vulnerabilities in software systems and help to protect information and systems against any relevant threats in order to innovate more strong defense devices. These cyber security analyses are important for social development, because they can protect the information of underprivileged social groups to avoid the information falling into bad guy hands. As more of our information is stored into a place. As cyber security develops, the threat is also coming. And network security must adapt to the new threats at any time. Imagine what would happen if we did not have cyber security, everyone's private information could be exposed. In addition, cyber security can save people’s life. In the near future, automation will be popular to replace some complex operations such as driving cars, exploitation of mine and high-risk motivations. Self-driving cars are what our report wants to achieve but imagine that if someone hacked into a car's driving system, they could cause a big traffic accident, even kill their life. This is not only about information theft, but also life or death situations. Literally, the huge requirements of cyber security in every industry. Because, at present, the internet is like a web to contact around us. For example, customer details of shops, staff management and banking systems all were needed.</p>
  
  <p>Cyber security affects me all the time. In the context of the report, I mention that cyber-infrastructure connects anywhere at present. What I do in my daily life is using the computer and phone, they are already becoming my life's component. Because of various reasons, we all need to attend class online, so I log in to my student account every day. Therefore, I frequently use phone apps such as Instagram, WeChat, and teams to communicate with my friends or group mates for daily interactions. Those things are able to make life easier and more effective. It is hard to imagine without the internet. Cyber security exists for management of those apps that can be stable running. Without cyber security, hackers would be able to access my account and steal all my personal information and make trouble in my life. Such as photos or text messages leaked onto public platforms. The elderly and children both are the most vulnerable groups, which was extorted easily by cybercrimes. They lack the security awareness of the network. It is a big part of them, which do not have abundant experience to guard against theft. For example, cybercriminals claim that a payment needs to be made because your children break a law and they have been in an inquest. Thus, you need to put up bail for releasing. When the victim can be tricked into transferring the funds to a bank account, the victim will be aware of the scam although it is far too late. As technology develops, cybercrime will become more sophisticated and effective.</p>

  <h3>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies: </h3>
  
  <p>News about blockchain and cryptocurrencies has become a popular topic in recent years. </p>
  
  <p>When news about cryptocurrencies comes out, it is often dismissed as a scam and a bubble. There is no denying that there have been a lot of scams in the cryptocurrency market over the past few years. We can also see this in the price of cryptocurrencies. But as the industry continues to evolve. More and more people are beginning to pay attention to the technology and the market. Blockchain is the technology that is made up of Bitcoin.Therefore, cryptocurrency and blockchain cannot be completely separated from each other. The two are coexisting. The emergence of the Internet has elevated the development of the world to a higher level.The Internet has changed the way people access information, allowing information to be free of barriers. The Internet solves the problem of people's information asymmetry.Blockchain solves the problem of trust between people.A blockchain is like a train, where each carriage represents a block and is then linked to each other by cryptography into an ever-increasing chain. The Transaction Hash, Status, Block number, Timestamp, the sending part, the receiving part, and input data are all available in a Block.Cryptocurrency is a new type of digital asset. Users can create a wallet themselves and remember the wallet's private key. They then transfer the cryptocurrency purchases to their wallets for storage. Or it can be transferred to a digital currency exchange for trading at any time. Compared to traditional assets such as gold, cryptocurrencies are portable and highly liquid.Cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, a decentralized way of keeping accounts. It is the complete opposite of the traditional banking system.In some underdeveloped countries, the national monetary system is relatively failed, and people's wealth will suffer devaluation every day. Out of distrust of the banking system, people will use cryptocurrency such as bitcoin to store their wealth.This also reflects the point of decentralization in the blockchain.Both blockchain and cryptocurrency have three attributes: anonymity, decentralization, and information is not tampered with.The use of cryptocurrency is now also very much, more as a currency transfer. Suppose Ben is an American who wants to immigrate or settle in Japan for a long time. He wants to change the US dollar into the Japanese yen. He has two choices, the first is to go to the bank to exchange, but the bank can not completely exchange into yen, it takes a long time and tedious. The second way is to go to some financial institution to exchange, but in this case, the cost of handling fees is quite high, and Ben have to bear certain risks. Obviously, these two situations are not feasible for Ben. Then Ben can buy bitcoin in the US cryptocurrency exchange, such as coinbase. Then he can create his own cryptocurrency wallet and record the private key. Put the bitcoin he bought into his wallet and keep his private key. When Ben arrives in Japan, he can register his account number in Japan's cryptocurrency exchange and transfer his bitcoin to the exchange in exchange for yen. This event shows the role of cryptocurrency in value storage, and shows the decentralized role of cryptocurrency and solves the trust problem.</p>
  
  <p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency essentially coexist, cryptocurrency is the embodiment of blockchain technology. The development of blockchain is also the development of cryptocurrency. It's like the relationship between a car and a tire. The most successful cryptocurrency is bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency with the largest market value. Behind it is the maintenance of countless developers and miners.Bitcoin is also the most successful experience in blockchain. Without bitcoin, people in many backward countries are still enduring the depreciation of wealth and the decline of purchasing power.Bitcoin is also recognized by more and more institutions in the traditional financial industry, and a lot of bitcoin related ETFs are gradually getting some attention in the financial market. There are many institutions, funds or individuals gradually pay attention to and recognize cryptocurrency.But it is undeniable that there are still many fraudulent and financial bubbles in the market of encrypted currencies, but the development of everything must go through these stages.In the next three years, we may see more bitcoin related funds or asset allocation. Bitcoin will also become a mainstream asset in the public's choice. And as long as the blockchain can be accepted by the public,Blockchain technology will also get more applications, such as in food traceability, art anti-counterfeiting and so on. </p>
  
  <p>There are many problems in the development of blockchain, and the attitude of various countries towards blockchain is not very friendly. Because there are a lot of scams around the blockchain, which is also the concern of the government. The public is also worried that blockchain will bring more negative effects.Cryptocurrency is the product of blockchain, and it is also the future of currency. Countries now have plans to study their own digital currency, so the use of digital currency is more secure. And once cryptocurrency is used, it will be easier for the government to control financial crimes or illegal transactions.If blockchain technology is applied in the future, it will be closely linked with our life. Artists can use blockchain technology to authenticate their works and get their own hash number through blockchain. In this way, users won't have to worry about the fake in the future.There is also the food industry, consumers want to see imported food is really transported from the origin. Consumers are afraid to buy fake imported food. The application of blockchain technology can trace the source of food. Food companies can record the data of each item, including the production date and specific production line, and upload them to the blockchain. In this way, consumers can find out the place of production and specific products when they buy.In some aspects of authoritative authentication, blockchain can also play a role. The government can authenticate some qualification certificates, such as education or business license for blockchain authentication.</p>
  
  <p>In the near future, if blockchain and cryptocurrency can be widely used, it will bring a lot of convenience and higher efficiency. For me, it will be related to my life, my major and my future industry are inseparable from blockchain.Maybe in the future, I will be exposed to the work of information security. I think blockchain can make information more secure, which is an innovative technology. I think it will greatly improve the whole industry. We always hear that a certain website or company has been attacked by hackers, resulting in the destruction or loss of data. These problems are caused by the concentration of software servers, which will cause serious losses once attacked. If in the future, blockchain is applied to information security, making the data records become decentralized.In this way, hackers' attacks can cost a lot, and thus avoid many losses.In the future, the government will adopt cryptocurrency. For me, it will make my daily shopping and international trade more convenient and security. For everyone, it improves the quality of life, makes people more trusting and efficient. For members of my family or friends, I don't need to worry about whether they will suffer from financial fraud, because the behavior on the blockchain can be found. Just check the data on the blockchain to track the flow of money and monitor it. The development of blockchain and cryptocurrency has been accepted by the public. Maybe in the near future, it is a mainstream thing to apply cryptocurrency</p>
